# Logic Building Programs in C

This folder contains core logic-based programs written in the C programming language.
These programs focus on problem-solving using loops, arithmetic operations,
and basic decision-making.

## Programs Included

1. Sum of digits of a number  
2. Reverse of a number  
3. Factorial using loop  
4. Fibonacci series  
5. Prime number check  

## Objective

The objective of these programs is to strengthen logical thinking and demonstrate
the correct use of loops and conditions for number-based problems in C.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Loop control (`while`, `for`)
- Mathematical logic
- Clean and readable code
- Problem decomposition

## Note

These programs are written as part of foundational C programming practice
during the first year of engineering.
